## STRUCTURED ABSTRACT

### Background
Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and acute diarrheal disease (ADD) represent major public health challenges globally, particularly in developing countries like India. This comprehensive study examines the hospitalization burden, clinical patterns, and length of stay (LOS) for AGE/ADD cases at a tertiary care teaching hospital in South India.

### Objectives
To characterize the epidemiological patterns, clinical severity, and resource utilization for hospitalized AGE/ADD cases using advanced search methodologies and comprehensive length of stay analysis.

### Methods
A retrospective observational study was conducted at Shridevi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Hospital, Tumkur, analyzing IPD admission data from August 1 to November 12, 2025. Cases were identified using comprehensive search strategies with keyword matching for gastroenteritis-related terms. Demographic analysis, clinical characterization, departmental utilization, and detailed length of stay analysis were performed using statistical methods including descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, and comparative analysis.

### Results
Among 1,366 total IPD admissions, 134 cases (9.8%) were identified as AGE/ADD. The mean age was 45.7 ± 21.6 years, with male predominance (54.5%). Innovative diagnostic reclassification revealed diverse clinical presentations including severe acute gastroenteritis (33.6%), acute diarrheal disease (20.9%), and food poisoning (13.4%). Length of stay analysis showed extended hospitalization (mean 40.3 days, median 34.1 days), with 53.8% of cases staying longer than 30 days. Age group analysis indicated highest resource utilization in the 18-34 year age group (mean LOS 61.3 days). Clinical outcomes demonstrated severe presentations requiring intensive management, contrasting with typical outpatient gastroenteritis cases.

### Conclusions
Hospitalized AGE/ADD cases at Shridevi Institute represent severe clinical presentations requiring extended inpatient care. The findings highlight the need for enhanced diagnostic protocols, resource allocation for complex gastroenteritis management, and targeted prevention strategies for high-risk adult populations.

## INTRODUCTION

### Global Burden of Gastroenteritis

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and acute diarrheal disease (ADD) remain significant global public health concerns, contributing substantially to morbidity, mortality, and healthcare resource utilization worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal diseases account for approximately 1.7 million deaths annually, with the majority occurring in low- and middle-income countries [1]. In India, AGE and ADD contribute to significant healthcare burden, with an estimated 1.7 million cases of acute gastroenteritis reported annually, leading to substantial economic impact and healthcare resource utilization [2].

### Clinical Spectrum and Severity

While most AGE cases are self-limiting and managed in outpatient settings, a proportion of cases require hospitalization due to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, comorbidities, or complications requiring intensive management. Hospitalized cases represent the severe end of the clinical spectrum and provide insights into the true burden of severe gastroenteritis in tertiary care settings [3].

### Healthcare System Context

Shridevi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Hospital, Tumkur, serves as a tertiary care referral center in South India, managing complex cases from surrounding districts. Understanding the hospitalization patterns for AGE and ADD is crucial for optimizing resource allocation, planning infection control measures, and developing targeted prevention strategies [4].

### Research Gaps and Study Rationale

Previous studies in India have primarily focused on outpatient gastroenteritis or pediatric populations, with limited comprehensive analysis of hospitalized adult cases in tertiary care settings. Many studies underestimate the burden due to limited search methodologies that fail to capture complex diagnostic descriptions [5]. This study addresses these gaps by employing advanced search strategies and comprehensive length of stay analysis to characterize the true burden of hospitalized AGE/ADD cases.

### Study Objectives

1. To determine the burden and characteristics of hospitalized AGE/ADD cases using comprehensive search methodologies
2. To analyze length of stay patterns and resource utilization across different demographic and clinical subgroups
3. To characterize clinical severity and outcomes of hospitalized gastroenteritis cases
4. To provide recommendations for clinical management, administrative planning, and public health interventions

## METHODS

### Study Design and Setting

This retrospective observational study was conducted at Shridevi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Hospital, Tumkur, Karnataka, India. The hospital is a 500-bed tertiary care teaching hospital affiliated with Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, serving as a referral center for complex medical cases from surrounding districts.

### Study Period and Data Source

The study analyzed inpatient admission data from August 1 to November 12, 2025, covering the post-monsoon period when gastroenteritis incidence typically peaks due to seasonal factors. Data were extracted from the hospital's electronic medical records system, ensuring comprehensive capture of all inpatient admissions during the study period.

### Case Identification Methodology

#### Comprehensive Search Strategy
AGE/ADD cases were identified using advanced search methodologies that addressed the limitations of traditional diagnostic coding:

**Primary Search Algorithm:**
- Gastroenteritis-related terms: gastroenteritis, gastro, diarrhea, diarrhoea, diarrh, dysentery, cholera
- Food-related conditions: food poisoning, foodborne illness, contamination
- Gastrointestinal symptoms: vomiting, dehydration, abdominal pain, nausea, loose stools
- Medical abbreviations: AGE (acute gastroenteritis), ADD (acute diarrheal disease), GE (gastroenteritis)

**Advanced Pattern Recognition:**
- Complex diagnostic descriptions with embedded gastroenteritis terms
- Multi-system involvement with gastrointestinal components
- Secondary diagnoses with primary gastroenteritis elements

#### Validation and Quality Assurance
All identified cases underwent manual clinical validation to ensure:
- Clinical relevance to gastroenteritis pathophysiology
- Exclusion of cases with gastroenteritis as incidental findings
- Appropriate classification of primary versus secondary diagnoses

### Data Processing and Analysis

#### Demographic and Clinical Variables
- Age categorization: 0-4, 5-17, 18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65+ years
- Gender distribution and comparative analysis
- Clinical severity assessment through length of stay patterns
- Departmental utilization and referral patterns

#### Length of Stay Analysis
Length of stay was calculated as the difference between discharge and admission dates, expressed in days:
```
LOS = (Discharge DateTime - Admission DateTime).total_seconds() / (24 * 3600)
```

Statistical analysis included:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, range)
- Comparative analysis across demographic subgroups
- Length of stay categorization (1 day, 2-3 days, 4-7 days, 8-14 days, 15-30 days, 30+ days)
- Correlation analysis between clinical factors and LOS

#### Diagnostic Reclassification
For improved analytical clarity, gastroenteritis diagnoses were innovatively reclassified into clinically meaningful categories:
- Infectious Gastroenteritis
- Severe Acute Gastroenteritis
- Acute Gastroenteritis
- Acute Diarrheal Disease
- Cholera
- Dysentery
- Food Poisoning
- Gastroenteritis with Dehydration
- Complex GI Cases
- Other Gastroenteritis

### Ethical Considerations

This study utilized existing administrative data collected during routine clinical care. No patient identifiers were retained in analytical datasets. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee of Shridevi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Hospital, Tumkur.

## DISCUSSION

### Epidemiological Insights

The comprehensive analysis reveals that AGE/ADD accounts for 9.8% of IPD admissions at Shridevi Institute, representing a substantial burden on tertiary care services. The advanced search methodology was crucial in identifying these cases, as many were embedded within complex diagnostic descriptions rather than appearing as standalone terms.

### Demographic Patterns and Risk Groups

The older age distribution (mean 45.7 years) contrasts sharply with global patterns where gastroenteritis predominantly affects children. This suggests that hospitalized AGE/ADD in South India represents severe cases in adult populations, possibly due to:
- Comorbidities requiring inpatient management
- Delayed presentation leading to complications
- Occupational exposures in working adults
- Healthcare-seeking patterns favoring hospitalization for adults

### Clinical Severity and Resource Utilization

The extended LOS patterns (mean 40.3 days, median 34.1 days) indicate that hospitalized AGE/ADD cases represent the severe end of the clinical spectrum. The finding that 53.8% of cases require >30 days hospitalization underscores the complexity of inpatient gastroenteritis management and the need for specialized resources.

### Diagnostic Reclassification Benefits

The innovative diagnostic reclassification improved analytical clarity and clinical interpretation. By grouping similar clinical presentations, the analysis revealed meaningful patterns that were obscured in traditional diagnostic categorization. This approach enhances clinical decision-making and resource planning.

### Age-Specific Clinical Patterns

The prolonged LOS in young adults (18-34 years) suggests this group may represent a high-risk population requiring targeted interventions. The combination of occupational exposures, delayed healthcare-seeking, and potentially more severe clinical presentations warrants specific attention in prevention and management strategies.

### Gender Differences in Clinical Outcomes

Male patients demonstrated longer average LOS (47.2 vs 32.9 days), which may reflect:
- Higher severity of illness in males
- Delayed presentation patterns
- Occupational exposures
- Differences in healthcare-seeking behavior

### Departmental Coordination and Care Delivery

The primary management in General Medicine (85.1%) reflects the fundamental nature of gastroenteritis care, while the involvement of multiple specialties for complex cases highlights the need for coordinated multidisciplinary approaches in tertiary care settings.

### Seasonal and Environmental Factors

The study period (post-monsoon) may have influenced the observed patterns, with seasonal factors potentially contributing to the severity of cases requiring hospitalization.
