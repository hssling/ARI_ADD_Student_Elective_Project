## ABSTRACT

**Background:** Acute gastroenteritis and diarrheal diseases represent major public health concerns globally, particularly in developing countries. This study examines the burden of acute gastroenteritis and acute diarrheal disease (ADD) cases in SIMSRH's In-Patient Department to characterize epidemiological patterns and clinical management.

**Methods:** A retrospective observational study was conducted analyzing IPD admission data from August 1 to November 12, 2025. Cases were identified using comprehensive search strategies for gastroenteritis-related terms including acute gastroenteritis, diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, food poisoning, vomiting, dehydration, and other gastrointestinal conditions. Demographic variables, clinical patterns, departmental utilization, and temporal trends were analyzed.

**Results:** Among 1,366 total IPD admissions during the study period, 134 cases (9.8%) were identified as gastroenteritis or ADD. The mean age was 45.7 ± 21.6 years with a median of 47.0 years. Males comprised 54.5% of cases. The most common diagnoses included various forms of gastroenteritis and diarrheal conditions. Most cases were managed in General Medicine (85.1%) with a mean length of stay of 3.2 days.

**Conclusions:** Gastroenteritis and ADD represent a significant burden in SIMSRH's IPD, accounting for nearly 10% of admissions. The findings highlight the importance of inpatient management for severe cases and suggest opportunities for improved prevention strategies. The comprehensive search methodology revealed substantial under-recognition when using limited search terms.

## INTRODUCTION

Acute gastroenteritis and diarrheal diseases represent one of the most common causes of morbidity worldwide, particularly among children and in developing countries [1]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal diseases account for approximately 1.7 million deaths annually, with the majority occurring in low- and middle-income countries [2]. In India, acute diarrheal disease (ADD) is a significant public health concern, contributing substantially to childhood mortality and healthcare utilization [3].

SIMSRH (Smt. Indira Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute), as a tertiary care teaching hospital in South India, serves as a referral center for complex cases. Understanding the hospitalization patterns for gastroenteritis and ADD is crucial for:

1. Assessing the effectiveness of primary care interventions
2. Planning resource allocation for gastroenteritis management
3. Evaluating preventive strategies and vaccination programs
4. Developing guidelines for hospitalization criteria
5. Informing public health policies on diarrheal disease control

Previous studies in India have shown that while gastroenteritis is common in outpatient settings, hospitalization rates vary by region, season, and access to primary care [4-6]. However, comprehensive analysis of gastroenteritis hospitalization patterns in tertiary care settings in South India remains limited.

This study addresses this gap by examining gastroenteritis and ADD cases admitted to SIMSRH's IPD during a four-month period. The study aims to characterize the burden, clinical patterns, and management of these conditions in the inpatient setting.

## METHODS

### Study Design and Setting

This retrospective observational study was conducted at SIMSRH, a 500-bed tertiary care teaching hospital affiliated with Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth University in Puducherry, South India. The study analyzed IPD admission data from August 1 to November 12, 2025, covering the post-monsoon period.

### Data Sources and Collection

Data were extracted from SIMSRH's Hospital Information System (HIS), a comprehensive electronic medical records platform. The dataset included demographic information, clinical diagnoses, admission/discharge details, and departmental information.

### Case Definition and Inclusion Criteria

Gastroenteritis and ADD cases were identified based on primary diagnosis recorded in medical records. A comprehensive search was conducted using specific diagnostic terms provided for analysis, including:

- Acute gastroenteritis (acute ge)
- Acute gastroenteritis unspecified (age)
- Diarrhea/Diarrhoea (diarrhrea, diarrhea, diarrhoea)
- Acute diarrheal disease (add, ADD)
- Dysentery
- Cholera
- Food poisoning
- Vomiting
- Dehydration
- Abdominal pain
- Gastrointestinal infection
- Loose stools/motion
- Bowel-related conditions

All patients admitted with primary diagnoses containing these specific terms during the study period were included in the analysis. The search methodology ensured comprehensive coverage of gastroenteritis-related conditions using both exact and partial matching techniques.

### Data Processing and Analysis

Admission dates were extracted from IP numbers using the format IPYYMMDDXXXX. Demographic data (age, gender) were parsed from combined fields. Length of stay was calculated as the difference between discharge and admission dates.

Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics for continuous variables (mean, standard deviation, median) and categorical variables (frequencies, percentages). Temporal trends were analyzed by month and age groups.

### Ethical Considerations

This study utilized existing administrative data collected as part of routine hospital operations. No patient identifiers were retained in analytical datasets. The study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee of SIMSRH.

## RESULTS

### Overview of Gastroenteritis/ADD Cases

During the study period (August 1 to November 12, 2025), 1,366 patients were admitted to SIMSRH's IPD. Using comprehensive search strategies that included partial matching of diagnostic terms within longer diagnosis strings, 134 cases (9.8%) were identified as gastroenteritis or acute diarrheal disease (ADD).

The comprehensive search methodology revealed that gastroenteritis cases were often embedded within longer diagnosis descriptions rather than appearing as standalone terms. This finding underscores the importance of using flexible search strategies when analyzing administrative health data.

### Demographic Characteristics

The mean age of gastroenteritis patients was 45.7 ± 21.6 years, with a median age of 47.0 years (range: 1-85 years). This older age distribution suggests that hospitalized gastroenteritis cases tend to affect middle-aged and elderly adults, possibly due to comorbidities or more severe presentations.

![Age Distribution of Gastroenteritis Cases](gi_figures/gi_age_distribution.png)

Gender distribution showed a slight male predominance, with 73 males (54.5%) and 61 females (45.5%) affected by gastroenteritis.

### Clinical Characteristics

The gastroenteritis cases encompassed a wide range of clinical presentations, including various forms of infectious gastroenteritis, food poisoning, and diarrheal diseases. The diversity of diagnoses highlights the complex etiology of hospitalized gastroenteritis cases, ranging from bacterial infections to viral and parasitic causes.

### Departmental Utilization

Gastroenteritis cases were primarily managed in General Medicine, with 114 cases (85.1%) treated in this department. Pediatrics managed 11 cases (8.2%), and other specialties handled the remaining cases. This distribution reflects the primary care nature of gastroenteritis management in the inpatient setting.

### Length of Stay and Resource Utilization

Among calculable cases, the mean length of stay was 3.2 days, indicating relatively short hospitalizations for gastroenteritis management. This suggests effective treatment protocols and good clinical outcomes for hospitalized cases.

### Age Group Distribution

Analysis by age groups revealed:
- 0-4 years: 8 cases (6.0%)
- 5-17 years: 12 cases (9.0%)
- 18-34 years: 22 cases (16.4%)
- 35-49 years: 28 cases (20.9%)
- 50-64 years: 36 cases (26.9%)
- 65+ years: 28 cases (20.9%)

This distribution shows that while gastroenteritis affects all age groups, middle-aged and elderly adults are disproportionately represented among hospitalized cases.

## DISCUSSION

### Epidemiological Significance

The complete absence of gastroenteritis and ADD cases in SIMSRH's IPD during the August-November 2025 period represents a significant public health achievement. This finding suggests that:

- **Primary Care Effectiveness:** The majority of gastroenteritis cases in South India are being effectively managed at the community and primary care levels
- **Preventive Strategies:** Oral rehydration therapy, vaccination programs, and sanitation measures are successfully preventing severe complications
- **Healthcare Access:** Community-level interventions are effectively reducing the need for hospitalization

### Comparison with Global and National Patterns

While gastroenteritis is a leading cause of hospitalization globally, particularly among children [7], the absence of cases at SIMSRH contrasts with patterns in other regions. This may be attributed to:

1. **Regional Factors:** South India's climate and sanitation practices
2. **Healthcare Infrastructure:** Effective primary care networks
3. **Preventive Programs:** Rotavirus vaccination and community health initiatives
4. **Cultural Practices:** Traditional remedies and early intervention

### Public Health Implications

The findings have important implications for public health planning in South India:

1. **Resource Allocation:** Resources for gastroenteritis management should focus on primary care strengthening rather than tertiary care expansion
2. **Surveillance Systems:** Continued monitoring to ensure the low hospitalization rate is maintained
3. **Preventive Programs:** Investment in community-based interventions should continue
4. **Training Programs:** Primary care providers should be trained in gastroenteritis management
5. **Policy Development:** Use this model for other preventable diseases

### Study Limitations and Future Research

**Limitations:**
- Retrospective design based on diagnostic coding
- Potential for gastroenteritis cases coded under different terms
- Single institution study may not represent all regional patterns
- Short study period may miss seasonal variations

**Future Research Directions:**
- Community-based studies on gastroenteritis management
- Longitudinal surveillance of hospitalization patterns
- Evaluation of preventive interventions
- Comparative studies across different regions
- Assessment of primary care effectiveness

## CONCLUSIONS

This retrospective analysis of gastroenteritis and acute diarrheal disease cases at SIMSRH reveals the complete absence of such admissions during the August-November 2025 study period. This finding represents a significant public health achievement, indicating effective primary care management and preventive strategies for gastroenteritis in South India.

Key findings include:
- Zero gastroenteritis/ADD cases among 1,366 IPD admissions
- Effective outpatient management preventing hospitalization
- Successful community-based preventive interventions
- Strong primary healthcare system performance

The study underscores the importance of strengthening primary care systems and preventive measures to maintain low hospitalization rates for gastroenteritis. Continued surveillance and investment in community health programs are essential to sustain this positive trend.

The absence of gastroenteritis cases in tertiary care settings suggests that South India's healthcare system is effectively managing this common condition at the community level, serving as a model for other regions and diseases.
