- TB wards indicate infectious disease burden
- Wide distribution across 401 different ward/bed combinations

DATA QUALITY ISSUES
==================
1. ICD Code Coverage: Only 8 out of 1366 records have ICD codes (0.6% coverage)
2. Missing Discharge Dates: 3 records missing discharge time
3. Length of Stay Anomalies: Negative LOS values and extremely long stays
4. Unnamed Columns: Columns 12 and 13 appear to be unused or improperly labeled

RECOMMENDATIONS
==============
1. Improve ICD coding compliance and training
2. Implement data validation checks for admission/discharge dates
3. Review LOS data quality and investigate extreme values
4. Standardize diagnosis recording and coding
5. Consider seasonal staffing adjustments based on admission patterns
6. Evaluate capacity planning for MICU and specialized wards
7. Focus quality improvement on respiratory and febrile illness management

CONCLUSION
==========
The SIMSRH IPD data reveals a high-volume service with significant focus on general medicine, paediatrics, and respiratory care. The patient population shows a bimodal age distribution with peaks in pediatric and geriatric groups. Clinical patterns are dominated by respiratory infections and febrile illnesses. While temporal patterns show stable monthly volumes, data quality issues particularly around ICD coding and length of stay calculations need immediate attention for better clinical and operational insights.
